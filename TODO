TODO:
-change value dump type for sth more memory-efficient than char
-eliminate usage of BOOST_FOREACH (?)
-add boost headers for shared_ptr and BOOST_FOREACH (if they are not thrown out) in case boost is not installed on a computer
-tune fst scope writing (the thing with up- and downscoping)
-do sth with timescales. For the time being they are parsed, but not used in comparison
